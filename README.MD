Team Deus Vult's robot monitoring webapp. Data is sent over Wi-Fi from our robot's software, converted from raw TCP sockets into WebSockets
and then displayed and processed in the browser.

Web developers, fear not! We use all the trendy things:

- Pug for HTML
- Stylus for CSS
- Webpack

As well as:
- Smoothiecharts
- Python for WebSocket relay (don't think Python is _that_ trendy)

Based on this template: https://github.com/koyta/pug-stylus-webpack-template
