# Aquila
Team Deus Vult's robot monitoring webapp. Data is sent over Wi-Fi from our robot's software, converted from raw TCP sockets into WebSockets
and then displayed and processed in the browser.

Reason for the name: "Aquila" means "eagle" in Latin, and we're keeping a bird's eye view on our robots :sunglasses:

To all you web developers out there - fear not! While we are boring C programmers, Aquila does actually use all the hip and trendy things:

- Pug
- Stylus
- Webpack
- Bootstrap

As well as:
- Smoothiecharts
- Python for the WS relay
- ...jQuery (very trendy, I know)

Based on this template: https://github.com/koyta/pug-stylus-webpack-template
